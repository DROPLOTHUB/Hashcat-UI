# Hashcat-UI
Hashcat but in a UI form



Yes this is a thing that i have been working on since around 2019 but just got back to the project this UI isnt going to be amazing its not going to have indepth features but it will have all the methods and options and cracking types avalible on launch of the program.

Also i have already implimented some of the requirments to have john-the-ripper which is a tool that allows you to extract hashes out of passworded files and other stuff this will also be interagted aswell with it. 


# The way it works?
1. firstly this program doesnt intergate hashcat and its required files in one program you will have to intergrate your version to the UI which is usially simple as downloading the newest hashcat and then making a folder extracting the folder contents inside the one you created and then simply drag and paste the UI in the same folder.

2. How it builds the command to execute your choices is basically in the background writing the .bat file as you would do normally like for example hashcat.exe X X X X you get the point this UI is mainly for the people that dont wanna have to use the command line side of hashcat. 




# Has it worked using my UI?

yes i was able crack a password from a protected docx document which one of my reletives fogotten the password and as i used a dictonary attach method i was able to get past within around 5 minutes as the passwork was only four characters long but this was a great test to see if my UI did work in a situation where i needed a quick way of choosing the method and the attach method.


# when will the release of the program be?
the release of the program in its stage is halfway done but i have colledge and work so any time i get i do tinker with my projects and gets something done.
so the first version of the program maybe 2 to 3 months.
im also open to more experianced developers to message me and give me some learning lessons on best was of coding this type of program this program is my take of what im mainly capable of at the moment 
i do have great experiance in C# some LUA little c++  but C# is what this is going to be maid in as its my strongest in the understanding
