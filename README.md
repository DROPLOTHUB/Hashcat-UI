# Hashcat-UI
Hashcat but in a UI form



Yes this is a thing that i have been working on since around 2019 but just got back to the project this UI isnt going to be amazing its not going to have indepth features but it will have all the methods and options and cracking types avalible on launch of the program.

Also i have already implimented some of the requirments to have john-the-ripper which is a tool that allows you to extract hashes out of passworded files and other stuff this will also be interagted aswell with it 


The way it works?
